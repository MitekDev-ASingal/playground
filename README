To use MiSnapSDK in Eclipse:

1) Import into your workspace as a library project (See 
    http://developer.android.com/tools/projects/projects-eclipse.html#ReferencingLibraryProject)
2) Create your application (YourApp) in your workspace
3) In YourApp properties, add the library you imported
4) Code the call to start the library, and onActivityResult to receive the returned image, per the SDK Programmer's Guide
